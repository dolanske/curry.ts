# Yeah you read that right

We've all heard after the success of jCurry.js, that there will never be a successor. Something, that will beat its simplicity, DX and API. What if I told you, and you may want to sit down for this one, that there is something that could potentially beat jCurry.js?

## jCurry.ts

- 100% test coverage (I've never written a test in my life)
- Fully written in typescript
- In-DOM support (what?)
- All functions from jCurry and much more! (see you in 3 years)
