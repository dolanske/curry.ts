# J C U R R Y (curry.ts)

The successor to the most known word in the javascript universe. Every person who came within 5km radius of an IDE has heard of that word. Some shiver, some get excited, some faint when they hear it. What if I told you that you don't need a 40k behemoth of a javascript object? That you actually just need a little curry in your life instead?

## Installation

Because I have literally 0.1 braincells, idk how to set up npm. You directly install this repo and it will clone the `/dist` folder into your node_module.

 `npm install github:dolanske/v-valid`

Or you can just copy and paste the `curry.mjs` file wherever in your project and simply import the `import { $ } from "curry"` instead.
